✨ Introduction

🎯 Goal

Create a personal portfolio landing page using HTML and CSS that introduces who you are and showcases your projects — just like a real developer’s website.

By completing this challenge, you’ll practice:

Structuring a webpage with HTML
Styling sections with CSS
Organizing content using Flexbox
Applying consistent spacing, colors, and layout

🧱 Requirements

Your page must include these 4 main sections:

🟤 1. Navigation Bar

A top bar that includes at least four links, such as:

Home
About Me
Projects
Contact
Use <nav>, <ul>, <li>, and <a> to structure it.
Add hover effects to make links interactive.

🟤 2. Hero Section

A welcome message introducing yourself.
Include a short description (one or two sentences).
Add an image or placeholder (e.g., 300x200) to make it visually appealing.
Use background color to make this section stand out.

🟤 3. Projects Section

A section titled “My Projects.”
Display at least three project cards, each with:
An image
A project title
A short description
Arrange the projects side by side using Flexbox.

🟤 4. Footer

A footer at the bottom that includes:
Privacy Policy
Terms of Use
Contact Info

🎨 Styling Guidelines

Use Flexbox for alignment and spacing.
Apply consistent colors, padding, and font sizes.
Add hover effects for interactivity.
Use at least one box-shadow or border-radius for design polish.

💡 Bonus Ideas (Optional)

Add a logo or your name to the nav bar.
Use different background colors for each section.
Include social media icons or links in the footer.
Try to make it mobile responsive using media queries.

🧩 Starter Hint

Structure your HTML using this basic layout (you’ll fill in the details!):

<nav></nav>
<section class="hero"></section>
<section class="projects"></section> -- I used the name "portfolio" instead of "projects"
<footer></footer>
