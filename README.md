🌐 My First Web Page
🧭 Introduction

This project satisfies the requirements for the Event Center Website Activity in the HTML module. This project was created by Heather Rutherford and is part of a journey to refresh and enhance web development skills. This site includes the index.html page that represents the landing page, an about.html page that describes the "about" behind the website, the events.html page that displays events scheduled or has happened at the event center, a contact-us.html page that allows visitors to contact the owners/administrators of the event center, and the styles.css page that provides the style for the index.html page. Five stylesheets are included in the project - a common stylesheet that provides styling for the common elements that are seen on the various pages such as menus and footers. Each page also has it's own stylesheet that provides specific styling to that page.

The project contains four pages, five stylesheets and a README file:

index.html - the homepage of the airbnb and event center site.

about.html - provides "about us" information or the story behind the airbnb and event center.

events.html - displays events that are scheduled or have occurred in the past.

contact-us.html - allows visitors to the site to contact the owners/administrators of the airbnb and event center.

common.css - The style sheet that provides the styling for the common elements shared between the different pages such as the menus and the footers.

index.css - styles specific to the index.html page.

about.css - styles specific to the about.html page.

events.css - styles specific to the events.html page.

contact-us.css - styles specific to the contact-us.html page

✨ Introduction

🎯 Goal
By completing this project, you’ll demonstrate your mastery of HTML and CSS fundamentals while creating a realistic Event Center website that you can showcase in your portfolio! 🌟

🧱 Project Description
In this project, you will design and build a multi-page Event Center website that showcases your event offerings, schedule, and venue details. This is your opportunity to bring a real-world scenario to life using everything you’ve learned so far—semantic HTML, layout design, forms, responsive styling, and interactivity.

Here’s the fun part: you get to choose the theme or type of event center! 🎉 Whether it’s a wedding venue, concert hall, conference center, or a festival arena, this is your chance to pick your favorite scenario and design a website that reflects that choice. Think of it as simulating a real event center—how would you present it online? What features and visuals would make it appealing to potential clients or visitors?

This project is your moment to be creative and strategic:

Organize pages logically (Home, About, Events, Booking, Contact, etc.)
Highlight your offerings with interactive and engaging sections
Use forms, schedules, and visuals to make your website functional and user-friendly
Apply your own design style to create a polished, professional result

🧱 Requirements

🏗️ HTML Structure
Your website should include at least three pages, such as:

index.html — Home page (introduction to the event center and featured events)
about.html — About the venue (history, mission, team)
events.html — Event listings or schedule
Each page should include:

Proper use of semantic HTML tags (header, nav, main, section, article, footer, etc.)
A navigation menu linking all pages together
Headings (h1–h6), paragraphs, and lists (ordered and unordered)
At least one table (for example, an event schedule or ticket pricing table)
Images with alt text in different formats (.jpg, .png, .gif)
Links (internal, external, and anchor links)
A contact form with text inputs, email input, textarea, and a submit button for inquiries or bookings
A footer with social media links or copyright information

🎨 CSS Styling
Use an external CSS file to style your website. Your CSS should include:

A consistent color scheme and typography appropriate for an event center
Proper box model usage (padding, margin, border)
Flexbox or CSS Grid for layout organization
Hover and focus effects for interactive elements (buttons, links, images)
Background images, gradients, or patterns
At least one class selector and one ID selector
Custom button styles for your form or links
A responsive layout that adapts to mobile and desktop screens

✨ Bonus (Optional)
Add CSS transitions or animations (for event cards or buttons)
